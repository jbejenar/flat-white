> Updated: 2026-04-07. Active phase: E1 (Ongoing) — P4 blocked.

## Completed This Session (2026-04-07, session 5)

### E1.05 — Geoparquet Output (done — roadmap updated)

- [x] Roadmap updated: code already existed, checkboxes checked with evidence

### E1.08 — GitHub Pages Catalogue (done)

- [x] `src/generate-catalogue.ts` + 14 unit tests
- [x] `.github/workflows/catalogue.yml` deploys on release publish
- Note: GitHub Pages must be enabled in repo settings (source: GitHub Actions)

## Completed Prior Sessions

### E1.06 — Build Cache (in-progress)

- [x] `--dump-db` / `--restore-db` flags in docker-entrypoint.sh
- [x] `actions/cache@v4` integration in quarterly-build.yml
- [ ] Build time reduction verified in production (DEFERRED: v2026.05)

### E1.01 — Parquet Output (done — roadmap updated)

- [x] Roadmap updated to reflect PR #57 merge

## Remaining P4 Work (all BLOCKED)

### P4.03 — Build-Over-Build Comparison (in-progress)

- [ ] Needs second release to verify (v2026.05 expected May 2026)

### P4.06 — Runbook (in-progress)

- [ ] Tested by uninvolved person [BLOCKED: requires human tester]

### P4.07 — NSW Memory Optimisation (in-progress)

- [ ] NSW builds reliably on 7GB free runners (1/5 consecutive runs)

## Next E1 Work

### E1.10 — Shapefile Fixtures + Spatial Join Regression Test (planned, p1-high)

- [ ] Commit clipped shapefile fixtures + wire shp2pgsql into fixture build
- [ ] Run gnaf-loader prep SQL against seeded raw tables; derive `admin_bdys_202602.*`
- [ ] Remove pre-baked `address_principal_admin_boundaries` rows from `seed-postgres.sql`
- Origin: PR #67 retrospective — fixture has no visibility into shapefile loading or spatial join, which is how both the v2026.04 wards crash and streetType regression slipped past CI

### E1.02 — Delta Builds (planned, p2-medium)

- [ ] Depends on P4.03
